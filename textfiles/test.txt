Constructor for audio elements. The preload property of the returned object is set to auto and the src property is set to the argument value. The browser begins asynchronously selecting the resource before returning the object.

Note: An Audio element constructed with new Audio() won't be garbage collected as long as playback is in progress. It will continue playing and be audible until pause() is called or playback finishes.
